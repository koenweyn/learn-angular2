tweet: "Magical new ES6 Template Strings"
---

ES6 adds the ability to write long inline strings without having to use concatenation or other odd tricks. All we need to do is use backticks at the start and end of the string:

```html
let template = `
  <div>
    <h2>Rufferford's Travels</h2>
    <p>
      A most gripping tale of one dog's quest
      for more flavors.
    </p>
  </div>
`;
```
